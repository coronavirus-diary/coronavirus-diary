  "consentStepQuestion": "# Informed Consent\n\nSince the US has been short on test kits, we are trying to figure out how many people have symptoms that could be due to COVID-19. The information gathered from this app will help predict where hospitals will be under the most strain. Hopefully, doctors and supplies can then be sent to the right places.\n\nYou are anonymous. We don’t want to know who you are! We will ask for your zip code to count cases around specific hospitals. Your symptom severity will be used to guess how likely it is that you have COVID-19, and to see how many people in your region are becoming severely sick.\n\nTotal daily cases for zip codes will be provided to state and local health authorities, the CDC, and the US Government to help predict which communities need the most support. We will also make a map here on this app. Data will also be analyzed for geographic trends. For example, we might see fewer cases in areas that closed schools for a long time, or perhaps we will see that the epidemic slows down in hot weather.\n\nYou can come back later and enter new information on a different day. We will know it’s you and won’t count you twice. Maybe you feel a lot worse, or you got a COVID-19 test result and would like to let us know.\n\nWe will not sell this data. It will only be used for public health and research and deleted after the epidemic has run its course.\n\nIf this is all OK and you are 18 years old or older, please click \"I agree\". Otherwise, click \"No\".",
